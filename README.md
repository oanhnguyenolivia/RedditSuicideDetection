<h1>Reddit Suicide Detection using NLP</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project identified potential suicidal intentions within 226,704 posts sourced from the "SuicideWatch" subreddits. The project focused on comprehensive data preprocessing and employed a pre-trained FastText model for in-depth semantic analysis of the posts. Leveraging machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier, and Recursive Neural Networks, the project aimed to select the most effective model. The optimized model achieved an impressive accuracy of 92%. This project was designed to explore natural language processing techniques for detecting sensitive content online, contributing to ongoing efforts in mental health support and online community safety.
